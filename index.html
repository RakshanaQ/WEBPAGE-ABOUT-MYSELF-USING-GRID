            <h3 id="section1">Who I am</h3>

<p>Hi! I’m Rakshana, a BCA student at Kamaraj College (FacePrep Campus) in Thoothukudi. I come from a peaceful coastal town, Virapandianpatnam, and studied at St. Joseph’s School (CBSE). I’ve always been someone who learns by doing, and college has been my biggest teacher so far.</p>

<h3 id="section2">Where I Started</h3>

<p>
    I wasn’t the top of my class in 12th (65%), but I’ve always believed that marks don’t define your future — your mindset does. I had an 87% in 10th, and I knew I could do more if I found what I loved.
</p>

<h3 id="section3">How I grow</h3>

<p>
    I love learning! That’s why I’ve completed 75+ LinkedIn certifications, 4 Microsoft courses, and 9 TCS iON certifications. I explore topics like cloud computing, communication skills, and digital technology.
</p>

<h3 id="section4">My Tech Journey</h3>

<p>
    I’ve solved over 60 coding problems on HackerRank. It was tough at first, but solving them made me stronger. It taught me how to think step by step, not give up, and enjoy the challenge.
</p>

<h3 id="section5">Who I'm Becoming</h3>

<p>
    One of my proudest moments was winning a prize at the Techno Talk paper presentation with my friend Subha. We were the youngest team there!<br>I’m working on my communication, learning to ask for help, and becoming more confident in group settings. I know soft skills are just as important as technical ones.
</p>

<h3 id="section6">My Dream</h3>

<p>
    One day, I want to be an entrepreneur. Not just to build something big — but to create something meaningful, that opens doors for others and brings positive change.
